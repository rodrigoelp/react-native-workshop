# Debugging tools

Debugging is one of the tasks we do the most when writing/changing code. With typescript we have a few things less we need to worry about when dealing with javascript, but the community has suffered quite a lot with some of the tooling.

Then vscode came around and updated the community to a great environment in which you can inspect things, inject new state and work through. But, there are a few more we can look into that makes working with react native a truly unique experience.

## Reactotron

Reactotron is an environment specifically designed to debug and understand react and react native apps. It works by creating websockets so your computer can connect to it and get the state, events and log messages.

Let's connect our app with it:

First, download the app from the (releases page)[https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/releases].

While that is downloading, let's go back to vscode to start writing the code to allow reactotron to connect.

1. In our repo, let's create a special branch for reactotron, as we will be experimenting for a bit with this. `git checkout -b reactotron`
2. Add `reactotron-react-native` to the app `yarn add reactotron-react-native --dev`
3. At `./src`, let's create a file called `reactotronConfig.ts`
4. Let's configure reactotron to read automatically the app.

```ts
import Reactotron from "reactotron-react-native";

function getConfiguredReactotron() {
    const reactotron = Reactotron.configure({
        name: require("../app.json").name
    })
        .useReactNative()
        .connect();

    return reactotron;
}

const log = getConfiguredReactotron();

export { log };
```

5. We don't want this running all the time... just for development. Let's create a log definition we can turn on and off based on the development mode.

```ts
import Reactotron from "reactotron-react-native";

interface Log { // this matches a few methods of reactotron itself.
    log(...value: any[]): void;
    logImportant(...value: any[]): void;
    warn(...value: any[]): void;
    error(error: any, stack?: any): void;
}

class ProductionLog implements Log {
    log(...value: any[]): void {}
    logImportant(...value: any[]): void {}
    warn(...value: any[]): void {}
    error(error: any, stack?: any): void {}
}

/* ignoring the configure function */

const log: Log = __DEV__ ? getConfiguredReactotron() : new ProductionLog();

export { log };
```

6. Let's connect this with the app. In `./src/index.ts` add this line under `import { AppRegistry } from "react-native"`

```ts
import { AppRegistry } from "react-native"; // under this one.
import "./reactotronConfig"; // <-
```

7. Remove the app from the simulator.
8. Open the reactotron app (it should have downloaded already)
9. Compile and run. You should see a few messages pop in reactotron.
10. Open `store` and find any reducer, add the following line:

```ts
log.log(action);
```
11. Compile and refresh. You should see some of the redux actions popping here.

Reactotron can be configured as well to capture redux in all its glory... but we can do that a bit later.

Let's move to do a bit of testing to wrap up the day.
