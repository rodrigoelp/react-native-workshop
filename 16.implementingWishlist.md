# Implementing the wishlist.

Let's move faster... This section is about exercising our memory... pretty simple stuff.

1. We need to be able to select a movie, add a movie to a wishlist and remove it. You need to implement the following action creators:
    1. `selectMovie(movie: Movie): any;`
    2. `addToWishlist(movie: Movie): any;`
    3. `removeFromWishlist(movie: Movie): any;`
2. Then implement the `selectedMovieReducer` and `wishlistReducer`
3. Add the reducers in the action and the signature of the action creators as part of the action definitions.
4. Open `HomeView` and update the navigation line to remove the `selectedMovie` param and set the selected movie **before** the navigation happens.
    - At some point, we will come back to fix this separation between navigation and providing parameters. Don't worry about this.
5. Open `DetailsView` turn it into a container. Remove its navigation params and get the selected movie from its properties.
    - If the render complains about the instance, return null if the movie has not been selected.
6. Update `addToWishlist` to add the movie to the wishlist **before** it navigates to the next screen.
7. Remove references of the `wishlistStore` as we are not using it any more.
8. Turn `WishlistView` into a container. Remove its navigation params as you don't need it.
9. Fetch the `wishlist` from props as opposed of the `wishlistStore`.
10. Replace the reference of `this.removeMovie(item.item)` with `this.props.removeFromWishlist(item.item)`
11. Drop the method called `removeMovie`
12. Run it!


... Kapow?

13. Ah, we forgot to update `mainNavigator.tsx`. We need to update the routes as it needs to use the container as opposed to the view version of each screen. Go ahead and change those. Run it again, everything should be good now.

We have migrated a big chunk of the app to the store. We need to move one more thing into the store (connect, really), the navigation itself.
