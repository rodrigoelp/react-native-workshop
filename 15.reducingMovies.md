# Reducing movies

What do we need to do next? Let's migrate the logic that downloads the movies in `HomeView`... In there we download a page, then we merge the new movies with the ones we already had.

Let's move that functionality of downloading pages into the store.

## Before we get going...

### Things you might find useful
Here are some types that might be useful in the future:

```ts
interface FlixStore {
    pages: Page[];
    movies: Movie[];
    selectedMovie?: Movie; // later on we can change this to use tsoption :)
    wishlist: Movie[];
}

const initialState: FlixStore = {
    pages: [],
    movies: [],
    wishlist: []
};

enum ActionType {
    PageDownloaded,
    NewMoviesAvailable,
    DownloadFailed
}

interface ActionWithPayload<TActionType, TPayload> extends Action<TActionType> {
    payload: TPayload;
}
```

### Exercise

1. Create a `pagesReducer` function. It should reduce the `pages` already downloaded and stored and include a new page once that one has been downloaded. The reducer needs to respond to a `PageDownloaded` action. Keep in mind, you don't want to include pages that have been already downloaded.
2. Create a `moviesReducer` function. It should include new movies as stated in the `NewMoviesAvailable` action.
3. Create a `fetchPages` function which is an action creator. This action creator should:
    1. Download new pages as required
    2. Once it has indicated an action for a given page as "downloaded"
    3. It should proceed to make available the movies of the newly downloaded page.
    4. It shouldn't redownload a page that has been already downloaded.
4. Remember to include the reducers and action creators at the right place.
5. Modify `HomeView` to fetch the new pages.
    1. Update `mapStateToProps` to get the appropriate properties.
    2. Update the method `fetchPage`. You might need to remove *almost* everything. This change might break some of the existing functionality such as the loading indicator... that is fine for now.
    3. Update `componentDidMount` and `handleEndReached` to clean whatever is not required.
    4. Remove from the `HomeViewState` anything that is duplicated.
    5. Update `render` as you might have a few things broken. Anything that was pointing to `this.state.movies` should've moved to `this.props.movies` (I imagine).
    6. You should be able to remove everything related to `foo` or `hello` as we do not need that anymore.
6. Run it and check everything is behaving as expected.

## Checking some of the behaviour

One of the interesting things of redux is, you were focused on getting your data to be in the store and all of the sudden other areas of your app received some benefits for free.

For instance, notice how your app takes a bit to download the first page (if you want to add a delay to make it more obvious), tap on a movie, add it to your wishlist and tap on the next button displayed as part of your settings. You will land right back in the home screen and your screen already had its data available.

Although, we have also introduced a bug: if you try to download new pages after you have navigated from settings, the page number does not align with the pages we have already downloaded...We could fix it now... but let's move to more interesting issues. The wishlist.
