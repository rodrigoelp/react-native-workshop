# JavaScript is weird...

1. `null` is an object. It has an special meaning which is slightly different to every other programming language with `null`
2. `undefined` means "nothing", no pointer, niente, nada. This is a lot closer to `null` in other programming languages.
3. Some times, `null`, `undefined` and `0` can be used as `false`
4. An empty array... is also `false`: `alert(new Array() == false)`
5. Is quite important to know that `==` is very different to `===`. Always use `===` in your `if` statements.
6. `[] + "hello"` or `"hello" + []` is `"hello"`... because... JS tries to be magical... and it thinks that `string` is a `char[]` so... maybe you are trying to append two `char[]` together?
7. `{} + [] => 0`... but `[] + {} => "object"!`... to be more precise... the result of the second one is an object that gets serialised as a string.
8. There are multiple ways of declaring variables.
    - `var` declares a variable to the scope of its closest function.
    - `let` declares a variable scoped within its closest block
    - `const` is a constant reference (or value)

```js
function fallingWhale() {

    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { }
    console.log(i) // this is undefined, because let forces i to only exist in the for loop.

    for (var x = 0; x < 10; i++) { }
    console.log(x) // this is 10... :(
}
```

9. There are multiple ways of declaring functions
    - `function foo(args) {}` this is known as variadic functions
    - `const foo = (args) => {}` this is known as clousures
    - `function () {} === () => {}` this are anonymous functions (or callbacks)
    - In an object `foo() {}` this is a method. It gets defined as part of the object definition, so if you want to provide this method as a reference to another object/function, you need to call `.bind(this)` on the method to provide its context.
    - In an object `foo: () => {}` or `foo: function() {}`. These are literal methods. It closes on the reference of `this`, meaning: this is an instance method.

10. You can override the definition of `undefined`... why?... I don't know why you would... but you can. 
```js
undefined = "hello world"; 
console.log(newVar === undefined) => false
```

11. Argument definition in a function is just a suggestion or labels.

```js
function add(a, b) {
    let r = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        r += i;
    } 
    return r; 
}

// add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) => 36
// add() => 0
```

12. Event loop. JavaScript does not allow you to use multiple threads, instead it gives you something called the event loop to manage callbacks, async code and other things as if everything is single threaded. This leads to some pretty odd calls: if you want to delay something until the runtime is free, you queue it up as:

```js
setTimeout(callback, 0);
```

For instance:

```js
function foo() {
    console.log("This is the first message");

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Once the queue is over... this message will be printed!");
    }, 0);

    console.log("Second message, because this was not pushed to a different queue");

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("So... I guess this gets added to the queue and will be executed at the very end?");
    });

    console.log("Finished printing stuff. The current job of the queue is over!");
}

foo();
// This is the first message
// Second message, because this was not pushed to a different queue
// Finished printing stuff. The current job of the queue is over!
// undefined
// > Once the queue is over... this message will be printed!
// So... I guess this gets added to the queue and will be executed at the very end?
```

13.  Automatically introducing `;` for you. Javascript has this `feature` in which it tries to "help" you break instructions, just in case you forgot to add `;` at the end.

This means that the following function does not do what you expect:

```js
function add(a, b) {
    return
        a + b;
}

add(1, 2); // it returns undefined... then it ignores the math done.
```

Languages like typescript can fix those issues when you specify its return type:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return // this line errors saying "undefined" is not compatible with "number"
        a + b;
}
```

But, typescript can "guess" what you want to generate if you don't specify its return type. Although you will get a warning.

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
    return 
        a + b; // no error... just a warning saying "code unreachable"
}
```

**Why?**

The most flexible signature typescript can see is:
```ts
add: (number, number) -> number | undefined;
```

So, a single line return matches `undefined`, compiler is happy.

Why are we trying to understand this?

Well, we already looked at some code like this:

```tsx
render() { 
    return (
        ...
    );
}
```

The parenthesis tells both js and ts, this return statement is still open and jsc will include the `;` at the end of the parenthesis if is not indicated.

## Is there hope?

TypeScript will help you out tons, but unfortunately it still runs on jsc, meaning some of these issues can't be solved.

Additionally to this, tslinter reviews your code and helps you avoid a lot of these issues.
