# Configuring my environment.

There are very few things you **really** need to install to get started with react native. But, we want to get a useful environment to work with, so here is a step by step process to get everything installed:

## Let's start with the installation

### Step 1. Getting NVM

Instructions are specified [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md): 

But, the short version is:

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

### Step 2. Installing Node

React Native (currently), does not support node 10. The Facebook team and the open source community is working to upgrade it soon the latest version of node which is expected towards the end of October.

In the meantime, let's get node 8.

```shell
nvm install 8
```

Check the expected version of node was installed

```shell
node -v
```

While we are here, node will install npm, which is the package manager for node. It might be out of date, we can upgrade this by running:

```shell
npm install npm -g #-g means globally.
# A longer version of this command is:
# npm i npm -g
```

### Step 3. Yarn... although is optional if you don't want it.

Yarn is a replacement for npm. It has certain benefits such as smart caching and auto shrink wrapping. Additionally, is way less verbose than npm when installing things, highlighting issues that are important.

```shell
npm install yarn -g
```
Check yarn is properly installed
```shell
yarn -v
```

### Step 4. React Native CLI

The CLI allows you to great templates to easily kick-start new apps. RN has several boilerplate generators such as Ignite, Create React Native CLI, Expo, etc. We are going to use the basic app generator.

```shell
npm install react-native-cli -g # this will install react native in your global node library.
```

#### Testing react native cli.

If you are installing xcode for the first time, you might run into an issue saying `xcrun error: unable to find utility "instruments"...`

What this is saying is: you need to allow the command line tools as part of xcode. To solve this:

1. Open xcode.
2. Open preferences.
3. Open "Locations" tab.
4. On the Command Line Tools section, select the only xcode instance you have installed.

**You might be thinking...**

> Why do I want to install the CLI with npm? Clearly 'yarn' is inferior if you need to use npm!

In general, is a pretty bad practice (and you should **ALWAYS** avoid it) to mix the usage of npm and yarn. If you use npm for your global repo (remember the `-g`?) stay with npm to install globally. We will use yarn in the project.

### Step 5. Installing VsCode

This editor is brilliant. The more you use it, the more you like it.

Download it:

Optionally, you could install Facebook's editor:

[<img src="https://nuclide.io/static/logo.png" height="64" width="64" /> Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/).

Although, nuclide is going to try to force you to use flow.

### Step 6. Installing typescript (optional)

Installing typescript globally has a few benefits, you get to type a lot less 

>
> ./node_modules/.bin/tsc
>

To install typescript:

```sh
npm i typescript -g
```

Once more, check everything is good

```sh
tsc -v           # you should get typescript 3.x
```

### Step 7. Checking you have the right native tools

To work with react native, you need `xcode` (and `xcodebuid`) to compile and configure parts of your iOS code. Pretty much the same applies to android, you'll need: the android sdk, android studio and... java :(

In any case, we'll be using the iOS simulator pretty much for everything today. Testing on both devices at the same time is going to be time consuming when we are trying to learn. The user experience between both platforms is pretty similar when it comes to the react native code, configuring the application for iOS or Android is different enough that you need to know these two environments well enough and we don't have the time today. I'll leave the other platform as an exercise to the reader. (If you have your environment configured for android dev, you will be able to follow all the exercises without ever touching any of the iOS stuff)

Check you have the right tools:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### Configuring your VsCode

There are a few extensions required to have a great user experience:
- TypeScript Extension Pack: Code already has typescript support... But the extension pack adds a few extra touches such as auto import, linter, path intellisense, and the prettier formatter.
- React Native Tools: Adds support to react native cli. It also allows you to configure your editor to allow you to debug a react native app.
- Jest: Runs automatically unit tests as you code. Jest is the unit test framework pre-packed with react native.

## Personalising your editor

Obviously, this is your environment to work in. If you don't like the colour scheme/theme... Change it!

`Command + Shift + P` gives you the command palette. Now type: `theme` and choose one from the predefined ones.

Still, don't like it? Open the extension panel ( command + shirt + x) and type: `theme` and browse one of the many themes provided by the community. Choose `Material Theme` or `Darcula theme`...

Code comes with no icons so you can pick the theme it rocks your boat.

`VsCode icons` are pretty good.
`Material icon theme`  is also a nice choice.

Still, nothing? how about `cage icons`?

Have a play with the font, font size and other extensions these next few minutes before we start coding.

Here is a list of some of my extensions in case you are wondering what I use.
- VsCode Icons
- TODO highlighter: allows you to easily find the `// TODO: ` tag (and a lot of other tags too).
- Vim: nothing to explain here.
- Quokka: a live playground for typescript
- Indent rainbow: follow the rainbow to the next bracket.
- Color-highlighter: Shows me the colour of `#2b00b5` (for instance)
- Auto-close-tag and Auto-rename-tag: because _life is too short to match by manually_ `<View></View>`
- Editor configuration:
    - Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases) + [Inconsolata g](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface/tree/master/fonts/inconsolata-g)
    - Ligatures: On
    - Font Size: 13

## To test your environment...

1. Open the folder `./exercises/calculator` in a new instance of vscode.
2. In the integrated terminal (or a new terminal) type the following commands:
    1. `yarn`
    2. `yarn run compile`
    3. `yarn run test`
    4. `yarn run exec`
3. If all if this worked (test passed, it compiled and it run), then your environment is properly configured.
