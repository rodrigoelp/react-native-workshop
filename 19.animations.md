# Animations

Well... one animation.

## Background fading in

Animations provide a bit of life to anything we do. Let's implement a micro animation to the background if the `detailsView`

1. Open `detailsView`, see the first element rendered as part of the view? Let's open it (âŒ˜ + click).
2. Once in `FadeInBackgroundImage`, let's take a look at the `render` method. Instead of returning a `View`, it returns an `Animated.View`. In react native, animations are (for the most parts) declared, its elements will automatically react and perform operations as declared. Everything is contained under the `Animated` namespace.
3. Let's introduce two properties of this class. 
    1. `backgroundOpacity` of type `Animated.Value` (initial value is `0`).
    2. `backgroundAnimation` of type `Animated.CompositeAnimation | undefined`.
4. In the constructor, let's declare the animation as:
```tsx
this.backgroundAnimation = Animated.sequence([
    Animated.timing(this.backgroundOpacity, {
        toValue: 1, // because we want the final outcome to be opacity = 1.
        delay: 600,
        duration: 1500
    })
]);
```
5. As we want to automatically play the animation:
    1. In `componentDidMount`, call `this.backgroundAnimation.start();`
6. Almost there, we need now to specify how the transition from `0` to `1` is going to happen.
7. In `render` specify:

```tsx
const opacityTransition = this.backgroundOpacity.interpolate({
    inputRange: [0, 1], // this is going to animate from 0% to 100% of the time specified.
    outputRange: [0, 0.3] // In reality, we want the final applied value to be 30% of the actual opacity.
});
``` 
8. Include another property to the style: `opacity: opacityTransition` after the `height`property.
9. Build and run.

## Clean up

This animation is pretty short and it will terminate in no time. Nevertheless is a good idea to clean up or be sure the animation is over when the component is terminated, so the framework doesn't have to terminate it for us.

1. Introduce another property called `isPlaying = false`
2. Before we call `start()` let's set isPlaying to `true`.
3. the `animation.start()` method takes in a callback. Let's update the property to `false` in there.
4. Finally, in `componentWillUnmount` we check if the animation is playing, we stop it.

_Note:_ As stated before, we might not need to do this for this particular animation as it is too short lived. But, is always recommended to stop looping animations, long running ones or complex animations when leaving a component to save the framework from detecting it, because it does not kill the component immediately after the component is unmounted.

**Next,** we have a nice app... but it is downloading everything all the flipping time... how hard would it be to save the state of the app?
