# Understanding what we just wrote...

Let's open up `index.tsx` for a sec:

```tsx
// file ./src/index.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { View, AppRegistry } from "react-native";

// this func is also a class. Don't worry, this is a hack.
const App = () => (<View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: "red" }} />);

// you will need to register the class as part of your code and entry point.
AppRegistry.registerComponent("flixflix", () => App);
```

Another way of writing this code (in a syntax less js) is:

```tsx
// file ./src/index.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { View, AppRegistry } from "react-native";

class App extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: "red" }} />
        );
    }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent("flixflix", () => App);
```

What we just wrote before, was a component called `App`.

## What is a component?

A component is a way of describing a user interface, whose state is immutable and its lifecycle allows it to understand which of its children invalidates the render tree.

Components can be extremely simple, such as:

```tsx
// file ./src/greet.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

class Greet extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
                <Text>Hello World!</Text>
            </View>
        )
    }
}

export { Greet };
```

All this component does is display to the user the text `hello world`.

### What is that `export` at the bottom?

In JS and TypeScript, a file is a module, which is just a way of saying "a small-ish unit of reusable code". By definition, everything you write in a file is private to that file, its global variables, functions, definitions and instances, unless you state otherwise.

For instance:

```ts
// file: ./src/sampleTypes.ts

type A = "hello" | "world"; // anything of this type can only be "hello" or "world", it can not be "42"

type B = "Fairy" | "Dragon" | "Unicorn";

type C = A | B; // anything of this type will be any value of A or B.

export { C };
```

If we update our `greet.tsx` file to reference the new file we will be able to observe that, we can't use `A` or `B` directly, but we should be able to define a variable `C` and assign any of the values of `A` or `B`

```tsx
// file ./src/greet.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";
import { C } from "./sampleTypes"; // updating this to { B } shall generate an error.

let whatever: C = "hello"; // try to assign "42" and you will get an error.

class Greet extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
                <Text>Hello World!</Text>
            </View>
        )
    }
}

export { Greet };
```

## How do I use a component?

In the case of `Greet`, let's change `App` to greet us:

```tsx
// other imports
import { Greet } from "./greet"

class App extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={{ flex: 1}}>
                <Greet />
            </View>
        );
    }
}
```

## Types of components

We have seen so far two types of components:

- Pure components
- Stateless components

The one missing on this list is:

- Components

### Stateless components / Functional components

These sort of components are the ones we used the first time writing the `App` component:

```tsx
const NewComponent = () => <View />;
```

When the declared function returns a view of sorts, it is called a functional component. These are the easiest to write, and the ones with the most problems.

- Hard to read
- May develop performance issues

But is ok to use it for small things.

It is called *stateless* when the function receives no arguments (like the example provided above).

If you provide arguments, then the component turns into a functional component (because is a function).

```tsx
const NewComponentWithState = (props) => (
    <View>
        <Text>Say hello to {props.name}!!!</Text>
    </View>
);
```

And this is used as:

```tsx
<NewComponentWithState name="johnny">
```

### Pure component

A pure component assumes your component is completely immutable, and the only way for it to mutate the view is by updating its state.

For instance:

```tsx

interface ChocolateProps {
    type: "white" | "milk" | "dark";
    sizeInSquares: number;
}

interface ChocolateState {
    remainingSquares: number;
}

class Chocolate extends React.PureComponent<ChocolateProps, ChocolateState> {
    constructor(props: ChocolateProps) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { remainingSquares: this.props.sizeInSquares };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <View>
                <Text>I have {this.state.remainingSquares} left of chocolate.</Text>
            </View>
        );
    }

    eatChocolate() {
        this.setState({
            remainingSquares: this.state.remainingSquares - 1
        });
    }
}
```

### Normal Components

There is not much difference between `PureComponent` and `Component`. The declaration is almost the same:

```tsx
class BlackSquare extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={{ height: 80, width: 80, backgroundColor: "black" }} />
        )
    }
}
```

It will receive properties just like any other component (assume we defined some property called `size`):

```tsx
render() {
    return (
        <BlackSquare size={100} />
    );
}
```

### Component vs PureComponent?

There is only one difference: if you need to specify react how to compare changes between state, to determine if you need to re-render or not, then you ___should___ use a `Component`. If your state is _"simple"_ then you should stick to `PureComponent`.

Note:

By definition, all your state should be as simple as possible. So, most of your components will always be `PureComponent`

## Exercise: Changing the app to say hello to us.

On this area, you need to validate your code (`tsc`) and run it: `react-native run-ios` or `vscode > debug`

- Complete the implementation of `Greet` to take a name.
- Update `App` to provide your name.
- Include a `TextInput` to allow it to be dynamic. Remember, components are immutable. If you want to "save" its state, you need to capture it as follows:

```tsx
<TextInput
    style={{height: 40}}
    placeholder="Type here to translate!"
    onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({ name: text })}
    />
```
- Update the app, so it uses the new text that you have captured.
