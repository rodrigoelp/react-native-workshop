# Migrating the navigation

## Intro

Let's have a refresher, by now we have created reducers, action creators, state and containers. We have injected a navigator into each of the views/containers and other minor changes around.

Something you may have noticed by now:

- Redux action creators give you access to a `dispatch` function. It takes a `{ type: string }` or a `{ type: string, payload: T }` and it automatically calls the required method to perform reductions, instantiate new state, etc.
- A navigator container, gives you access to a `dispatch` function. It takes a `{ type: string, routeName: string }` or a `{ type: string, routeName: string, params: T }` and it automatically calls the required methods to perfom transitions, instantiate new views, etc.

This is no coincidence. React Navigation was models after redux concepts and until recently, it had full support of redux stores.

**However,** the team leading React Navigation had decided not to continue supporting (in full) the redux way. Some of that work has been pulled out into a different library called `react-navigation-redux-helpers`... So, I wanted to show you how to connect the navigation with redux and continue pushing forward, but reading [the integration page](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/redux-integration.html) and chatting with some of the maintainers I've got to the conclusion that is going to be better to not do this (react navigation is going to be releasing a new version of the library between september to november that might break redux).

If you are still interested on how to connect the navigation as the reduction of the navigation state, I've created a gist with the code (in javascript) illustrating the changes you might need to do [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/rodrigoelp/88680f4878a1269964a8937dc26905dc).

## Refactoring Navigation

The `dispatch` function of any navigator component is linked with any other instance of a navigator. Fortunately for us, we don't need to get all the different instances if we wanted to wrap these in a sort of service.

First, let's do some cleaning:

- Remove the `localStore.ts`... we are not going to be needing that (nothing should be referencing that module).

Now,

1. Create a file `./src/services/navigationService.ts`.
2. Include the following interface and class in it.

```tsx
interface NavigatorContainer {
    dispatch: NavigationDispatch;
}

class NavigationService {
    constructor(navigator: NavigatorContainer) {
        this.navigator = navigator;
    }

    private navigator: NavigatorContainer;

    goToDetails() {
        // TODO: this needs to be implemented.
    }

    goToWishlist() {
        // TODO: this needs to be implemented.
    }

    goToSettings() {
        // TODO: this needs to be implemented.
    }

    goToHome() {
        // TODO: this needs to be implemented.
    }
}

let instance: NavigatorService;
function initNavigator(navigator: any) { instance = new NavigatorService(navigator); }
function getNavigator() { return instance; }

export { initNavigator, getNavigator };
```
3. The `dispatch` function as exposed by the navigator takes in an action. These actions are available via `NavigationActions` or `StackActions`. For most parts you will need `NavigationActions.navigate` instead of the `push` we were doing before. Write the code to hook up details, wishlist and settings.
4. To hook up home, we want to reset to the lowest level of the stack. Luckily we wrote this code before in the settings screen.
5. In `AppShell`, the `AppMenuNavigator` component has a property called `ref` that takes in a lambda expression to expose its internal navigator component.
    1. Call `initNavigator` in there.
6. Open `store.ts`
    1. Find `selectMovie` and change it so it returns a thunk action, as you will need to dispatch the action and follow it with the navigation to the details section.
    2. Update `addToWishlist` as well.
7. Open `homeView` and remove the references to the navigation/navigator properties and reference (as we don't need this any more).
8. Repeat the step above in `wishlistView`
9. And again in settings. Although in settings you might need to call the `getNavigator().goToHome()` as settings is not even a container.
