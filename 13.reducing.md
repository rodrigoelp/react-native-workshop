# Reducing stuff

So far, we have built an application that can fetch data from our backend (but is not caching it), it can browse the details of a movie and add it to a wishlist (but it does not save it)... to be a pretty small app we have logic spread across multiple views.

_Enters **Redux**_

As its name implies, the idea with redux is to reduce the complexity of any architecture to steps that are easy to understand. Unfortunately, redux can be hard to understand when is poorly explained (pretty much anything really)... so I will try to do my best to explain it as clearly as possible.

Remember the `wishlistStore` we created before? that singleton that remembers what we added to our wishlist?
Do you also remember about the `selectedMovie` we had to provide twice as we navigated across multiple screens? How about if we try to gather all that state into something that makes sense... some kind of global store that understands the state required for the application to work properly. Let's call this `appStore`.

By pulling the state of the entire application into a single _store_ we can get predictability of what the app will do, because we can force the entire application to use a unique instance as opposed to each view pulling and copying its own version. A unique source of truth.

Now... passing the entire store to each view might be complicated, because not every view requires everything in this global store and how to modify this data should not be duplicated across each of the views (otherwise we achieved nothing)... Let's tackle this last part first, how to extract actions applied to data.

An _action_ should take some data and an intention to mutate data, without having to know what this data is meant to look like. An `action` should communicate to "something" saying: "Hey, I want to do download pics for this movie" and the action through some internal mechanism will update the store, which will update the view.

Ok... we have a `store`, `actions` and `views` (technically, `components`) but I got no idea how to map the important bits of the `store` to each of the `views` and I am not sure how to inject the `actions` so the `views` can use it.

To adapt the `store` and the `actions` to each `view`, we need to wrap the view into something that knows how to connect all the pieces together... We could write this ourselves, but `redux` already provides a mechanism to do this. When a `component` is connected to a `store` and `actions` it is known as `container`

But, going back tothe statement we had above... each view does not want to know **everything the app needs to know**, right? If only we had a way to reduce the amount of information provided to the view. These are known as `reducers` and all this need to do is:
only modify the data that is required and returned a modified store... That sounds simple enough. `reducer = (bit of store) => new bit of store`.

The idea is, the entire store should be composed of multiple small fragments, each of these would be modified by a `reducer`.

So... (too many terms, uh?)

To properly separate the logic, data and its display we need to:

- Create a store that contains everything there is to know about the app.
- Some reducers that know how to change related data in a consistent way.
- The actions the app or the user need to do in order to reduce bits of the store into understandable bits for the view to use.
- And we want to connect the view with all of the above without adding extra plumming. This wrapper is called a container.

## Changing to app to include redux

### Adding dependencies first

Redux is a framework that works great with react and react native... but is not exclusive to react. To get it to work we need two pieces: `redux` and `react-redux`. Additionally, we will add one called `redux-thunk` which we need to use to deal with async actions.

```sh
yarn add redux react-redux redux-thunk
```

`redux` and `redux-thunk` both include their own type definitions (because these are awesome). However, the team running `react-redux` has not included the type definitions required per default, so we need to add it from `@types`

```sh
yarn add @types/react-redux --dev
```

You should still be able to compile and run your app.

### Baby steps...

Let's introduce a change that is not going to be massive. All we want to do is to build a store that we will inject into the application. The store is going to be empty (at the moment).

1. Create a file called `./src/appShell.tsx`. This is going to be the real root of our app.
2. The `AppShell` is going to be a pure component that hosts the `AppMenuNavigator`.
3. In the `./src/index.tsx` replace the registration of the `AppMenuNavigator` with the `AppShell`
4. Create a file called `./src/services/store.ts`
5. In there we need to create a store by calling the `createStore` function exposed in the `redux` module.

```ts
const appStore = createStore(combineReducers({}));

export { appStore };
```

6. In `AppShell`: wrap the `AppMenuNavigator` with a `Provider` component of the module `react-redux`. You will need to specify a store in it... luckily, we created one already.
7. If you run your code, you will get a runtime error saying "You can't create an empty store!". We need to fix this. A store receives its shape from the reducers we are combining, each reducer is applied to a specify piece of the entire store.
8. Write a function (in the same file as the store... for now) called `helloReducer` as follows:

```ts
const initialState = { foo: "bar" };

function helloReducer(store: any = initialState, action: any) {
    return store;
}

const appStore = createStore(combineReducers({
    hello: helloReducer,
}));

export { appStore };
```

9. Run the app, everything should be working fine.

### What did we just do?

Not much really. We put in place the pluming to get redux to work... but there is no container listening to it.

What we have is a store with the following shape:

```ts
interface Store {
    hello: { foo: string };
}
```

But, nothing will change this store as there are no actions changing that `string`. If we had a container listening to it, the only data you will receive is `"bar"`

### How can I trust this is really working?

Easy... let's change the `HomeView` into a container.

1. Open `homeView`. Before exporting `HomeView` add the following lines:

```ts
function mapStateToProps(state: any) {
    return {
        fooo: state.hello.foo,
    };
}

const HomeContainer = connect(mapStateToProps)(HomeView); // this creates a new type called "HomeContainer"
```

2. Above the declaration of `HomeView`, we need to extends the `NavProps` the view takes as it needs to know about its new property called `fooo` (it can be just `foo` but this just demonstrate the props do not need to be named exactly the same as the store).

```ts
interface HomeViewProps {
    fooo: string;
}

type HomeViewJoinedProps = HomeViewProps & NavProps;
```

3. Change the properties type of the `HomeView` to use the joined version.
4. Change the "title" of the `HomeView` to include the value of `fooo`

```tsx
<Text style={styles.homeText}>Home!!! {this.props.foo}</Text>
```

5. Compile and run it again. You should see `Home!!! bar` at the top of the screen.

### What just happened?

Well, the store was already created from that initial state we specified before creating the reducer. That reducer is in charge of handling any kind of action performed on that bit of data (no actions so far).

The provider is waiting for any container to request the store and try to map its state as part of the properties of this component. At that moment, redux applies the reducer and injects the value it requires.

To change the value of the store we need an action that will communicate to redux saying "Hey, I got a message for the store, I want to change X to Y"... and to understand that let's migrate a bit more of the app into redux.
