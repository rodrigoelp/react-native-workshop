# Structuring the project.

At this stage, we have a working app (with a few details we need to fix) and the structure of the project is far from ideal, but this is a workshop and ideal is not necessarily what will help us learn faster.

In general, projects using redux tend to follow the structure described below:

```sh
./src/views/
./src/views/components # base react components.
./src/views/containers # in here you will have all the views connected to redux.
./src/helpers # or services or what have you... Anything that is supporting libraries
./src/store/ # main container for anything of the redux store.
./src/store/reducers # all the reducers organised by functionality / store
./src/store/actionCreators # all action creators organised by functionality / store
./src/styles/ # all the styles that apply to different elements.
```

Let's download the app we have been building that has been already organised (just the views)
