# Structuring the project.

At this stage, we have a working app (with a few details we need to fix) and the structure of the project is far from ideal, but this is a workshop and ideal is not necessarily what will help us learn faster.

In general, projects using redux tend to follow the structure described below:

```sh
./src/views/
./src/views/components # base react components.
./src/views/containers # in here you will have all the views connected to redux.
./src/helpers # or services or what have you... Anything that is supporting libraries
./src/store/ # main container for anything of the redux store.
./src/store/reducers # all the reducers organised by functionality / store
./src/store/actionCreators # all action creators organised by functionality / store
./src/styles/ # all the styles that apply to different elements.
```

## Quick update.

Let's download the app we have been building that has been already organised (just the views), with a few styles applied to most of the elements in `home`, `details` and we will still have some work to do in `wishlist` and `settings`.

We are going to be replacing most of the typescript and javascript files we have generated. If you feel attached to your code, then extract this folder somewhere else and copy the content that is different... but to speed things up, replace everything in:

```sh
./src
./static
./app.json
./package.json
./tsconfig.json
```
If you run the app right now, you will notice a few differences.

```sh
rm -rf gen node_modules && yarn && ./node_modules/.bin/tsc
```

## Spotting the differences

Take a few minutes to check the content of the files, as we will discuss a bit about it below.

### Project structure 
The project structure has changed a bit; The views we have been working on moved to `./src/views/containers` and a few elements we used to have in `homeView` or `detailsView` have moved to its own components stored in `./src/views/components`.

In components we will also have the app menu (now called `appDrawer`).

### Stylesheets

The stylesheet has grown substantially (even though it does not contain styles for everything).

### Image library?

We have an object called `ImageLibrary`, this is our catalog or assets library.

```ts
const ImageLibrary = {
    restricted: require("../../static/restricted.png"),
    notFound: require("../../static/nope.png"),
    faved: require("../../static/faved.png"),
    notFaved: require("../../static/faved-not.png"),
    iconFave: require("../../static/icon-fave.png")
}

export { ImageLibrary};
```

Here we can learn something new of react native. `require` is an interesting and bizarre function. It allows you to "read" files in your package, as well as loading new modules and images. For images in specific, `require` needs to know the path in advance, otherwise it reports a runtime error saying `"hey, are you trying to give me something dynamic? HA HA, flip off!"` (maybe not in those specific words, but it is the sentiment).

The reason for this is, the bundling process takes all the static paths, move the images into the native assets library and change `require("path/to/image")` with the proper native function to resolve that image with a given resolution (devices with high pixel density will resolve `@3x`, mid range will resolve `@2x` and so on).

For this small app, with a small set of images, we can create our object here (which allocates the memory to load these images). In a larges application might be wiser to turn all of these into lazy instances or function so the allocation happens when required and not on load.

You will notice a few more images in the `./static` folder.

_By the way, the folder name is not important... we could've call it `otherStuff` if we wanted to._

### Erm... constructors are weird now...

If you have opened `homeView.tsx` you will notice the constructor looks a bit different to what we had before:

```tsx
class HomeView extends React.PureComponent<HomeViewJoinedProps> {
    constructor(props: HomeViewJoinedProps) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            refreshing: false
        };
        this.renderMovie = this.renderMovie.bind(this); //???
        this.showMovieDetails = this.showMovieDetails.bind(this); //??????
        this.renderFooter = this.renderFooter.bind(this); // ????????
        this.handleEndReached = this.handleEndReached.bind(this); //???????????
    }
    //...
```

As it was stated as part of JS oddities, a `function` is different to a lambda expression (or "fat arrow functions" as JS peeps call it) and it can lose its context when passing the function reference to a different object.

Now, lambda expressions have a little penalty that is negligible for a few elements, but it can make things a bit slower for lots of elements. Changing a function to call `bind(this)` on the spot does not make things better. JS will still need to create a reference to the new modified function, every time it calls `render`.

To avoid this, we use the trick displayed above. When an instance gets created, you tell JS "look, this function is always going to have the same context... is part of this instance, ok?"

#### Hang on... you do not bind everything!

Ah well, if a function does not require its context, we can just leave it as is... less code to maintain.


**Do you have other points you want to discuss? ask away!**

Otherwise, let's do a small animation.
