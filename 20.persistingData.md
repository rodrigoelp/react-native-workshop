# Persisting Data

Our application:

-   Downloads the first page as soon as it loads the app.
-   Fetches new pages as we request them.
-   Displays details of a given move.
-   Allows us to add movies to our wishlist.

The problem is, as soon as I terminate the app is all gone. Let's implement now a process to save the information as it changes. All our information is conveniently stored "in-memory" in a redux store.

The best case scenario would be to store this in-memory representation and get on moving.

Well... there is a dependency that does just that.

## Redux Persist

Redux persist is a wrapper of a redux store, it will intercept every single call made to the store and preserve these changes as it goes. It also offers mechanisms to migrate old data structures when a new version of the application has been deployed.

## How do I use it?

First step, adding the dependency:

```sh
yarn add redux-persist
```

This dependency comes with its typescript definition already included.

Now, let's do some code:

1. Open `store.ts`
2. We need to refactor a bit our code, otherwise we will get an error later on. Extract the references of `appStore.getState()` into a function called `getState`.

```ts
function getState() {
    return appStore.getState();
}
```

3. Change all references of `appStore.getState()` to use the newly added function.
4. In the "building the store" section. Add a configuration of type `PersistConfig`. You will need to provide:
    1. A `key`
    2. A `storage` which is going to be `AsyncStorage`
    3. A `version` not required, but is better to provide a version in case you want to migrate data later on.
    4. And a `blacklist`. Again, not required but we are going to use it as there are a few things we don't need to persist, such as:
        1. `processStatus`
        2. `selectedMovie`
5. Next, extract the `combineReducers` part of the store into its own line.

```ts
const reducers = combineReducers({
    // the combined shape of the reducers must match the shape of the store.
    pages: pagesReducer,
    movies: moviesReducer,
    selectedMovie: selectedMovieReducer,
    wishlist: wishlistReducer,
    availablePages: availablePagesReducer,
    processStatus: processStatusReducer
});
const appStore = createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```

6. Unfortunately, at the time I created the type definitions for `redux-persist`, `redux` did not offer an `Action<T>` which we use here. If we try to change the `combineReducers` with the function we need to call we will get an error saying "I don't know how to convert action with payload into an any action!" We can fix that by providing some typing wrapping (and casting)

```ts
type ReceivedReducerType<T, TAction, TPayload> = (
    state: T,
    action: ActionWithPayload<TAction, TPayload>
) => T;

type ExpectedReducerType<T> = (state: T, action: AnyAction) => T;

function persistWrapped<T, TAction, TPayload>(
    reducer: ReceivedReducerType<T, TAction, TPayload>
): ExpectedReducerType<T> {
    return reducer as ExpectedReducerType<T>; // <- sorry Dave. =(
}
```

7. Now, let's connect the persistence with all the reducers. Replace `createStore` with `persistCombineReducers`
    1. The first argument is the configuration we already created.
    2. The second argument is the list of wrapped reducers.

```ts
const reducers = persistCombineReducers(persistConfig, {
    pages: persistWrapped(pagesReducer),
    movies: persistWrapped(moviesReducer),
    selectedMovie: persistWrapped(selectedMovieReducer),
    wishlist: persistWrapped(wishlistReducer),
    availablePages: persistWrapped(availablePagesReducer),
    processStatus: persistWrapped(processStatusReducer)
});

const appStore = createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```

8. Let's go back to fix `getState` as it might be complaining by now. A persist state might be in a state that is not ready to be read (although we never access it before that). So, update the function to:

```ts
function getState(): FlixStore {
    if (appStore.getState()._persist) {
        // appStore.getState() returns persisted state, but it feeds of the FlixStore.
        // we have to cast it to FlixStore.
        return appStore.getState() as FlixStore;
    } else {
        return initialState;
    }
}
```

9. Finally, we need to create a persistor from the store.

```ts
const appStore = createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk));

const persistor = persistStore(appStore);
```

10. Include the `persistor` as part of the exports.
11. In `AppShell`, we need to wrap the provider component with a new component called `PersistGate`, what it does is enrich the functionality of the `Provider` by restoring the previous known state.

```ts
class AppShell extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <PersistGate persistor={persistor}>
                <Provider store={appStore}>
                    <AppDrawerNavigator ref={initNavigator} />
                </Provider>
            </PersistGate>
        );
    }
}
```

12. And that is all. Compile, run download a page or two, add something to the wishlist and kill the app. Launch again and enjoy your persisted wishlist and movies.

## Notes:

Obviously, we don't need to store all the pages, movies, etc... If we really want to be efficient, we should exclude the redundant data and recreate everything that is required. For now, we will stop here.

**Next,** checking some other tooling to do react native debugging.
