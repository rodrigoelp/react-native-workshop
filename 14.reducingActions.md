# Creating actions to be reduced

To change an X to Z, redux will need to receive a parameter of sorts. But there some a bit of the information I provided that wasn't quite true, reducers do not take the entire store, each function only takes the bit that is interested.

## Fixing helloReducer

1. Go back `store.ts` file and find `helloReducer`. 
2. The initial state of `helloReducer` should be `initialState.foo`.
3. Also update the type of action from `any` to `AnyAction`
4. Go back to `homeView.tsx` and update the `mapStateToProps` to return `{ foo: state.hello }`
5. Compile and run. Everything should work as expeected.

With these changes in place we will start shaping correctly our store.

Next let's try to generate an action that will change `bar`

## And... action!

1. Go back to `store.ts` and find `helloReducer` (again).
2. In its body check if the `action.type` is identical to `"UPDATE_FOO_TO"` then return the new string attached to a property called `theNewString`. Typescript here is not going to complain that property does not exist because the type of the action is `any` and it allows you to call to anything you want.
3. Let's go a bit to the bottom of the file and add the following function:

```ts
function updateFoo(newString: string) {
    return { type: "UPDATE_FOO_TO", theNewString: newString };
}
```
4. Export the new function as we will need it in `homeView.tsx`
5. In `homeView.tsx`, let's enrich a bit more the properties we have created. Change `HomeViewJoinedProps` to include `{ updateFoo: (s: string) => any }`
6. Towards the bottom of this file, add a new object as follows `const actions = { updateFoo }`
7. Provide the actions as an argument of `connect` as `connect(mapStateToProps, actions)(HomeView)`
8. Finally, add the following line between the `Text` and the `FlatList` in the `render` method.

```tsx
<Button title="update me" onPress={() => this.props.updateFoo("Something dark side")} />
```

9. Compile and run. Tapping on the button should update `bar` to `Something dark side`

### What did we just do?

We have created the final piece required to update a redux store, we generated an **action creator**.

In redux, anything matches the type described below is an action:

```ts
interface Action<T> {
    type: T;
    [key: string]: any; // this allows the dynamic definition of new properties.
    // Interestingly enough, this is also the definition of dictionary of any type.
}
```

That means the function `updateFoo` is an **action creator** because it returns an object with a `type` property and any other property.

When we call a function that returns an action, the return object gets injected in every single reducer, each of these will provide a new store. Once there are no new actions, nor changes to the store the new state gets pushed into the container and react does its magic understanding what has changed.

Now... this is not going to quite work with our API, because an action is meant to return an object, not a promised object and our database is complete async. Let's do a few more tweaks to get into the proper state to migrate some of our functionality into the redux store.

## Thunk!

1. Open again `store.ts` and let's update our `updateFoo` action creator to return a function that takes a dispatch object as follows

```ts
function updateFoo(newString: string) {
    return (dispatch: Dispatch<AnyAction>) => dispatch({ type: "UPDATE_FOO_TO", theNewString: newString });
}
```

2. Additionally, let's extend the store to take a middleware that will help us deal with action creators that might be deferred. In this case, is not going to be deferred because is invoked immediately, but we will use it later. The middleware is called `thunk` (we have added that dependency at the beginning with `yarn add redux-thunk`)

```ts
//...
import { createStore, combineReducers, AnyAction, applyMiddleware, Dispatch } from "redux";
import thunk from "redux-thunk";

//...
const appStore = createStore(
    combineReducers( /*...*/ ),
    applyMiddleware(thunk)
);
```

3. If you compile and run, everything should be good to go.

### What is thunk doing?

In short, it detects the signature of an action creator returning a function that takes in a `dispatch` object. At that moment, it takes the returned function and proceeds to inject the right arguments once the call has been made, so you don't have to provide the dispatcher everywhere.

### And the dispatcher?

Indicates to redux that it needs to go through the reducers when an action is issued.

## Final thoughts on this part...

The code is starting to look a bit too messy, we have been writing everything in the `store.ts` file and we've created actions, models, reducers and so on...

Maybe we should try to organise a bit more the code by moving everything to the right spot... But, for now, let's keep pushing forward some more as we need to create a function to fetch pages, merge pages with movies, add things to the wishlist and what have you.

Next... reducing movies and pages.
