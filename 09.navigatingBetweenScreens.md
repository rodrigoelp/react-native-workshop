# Navigation

Given the modular design of React Native, there are multiple components designed (and maintained) by different communities. Navigation is one of those components that has been pulled out of the base framework and maintained by two different groups.

The reason why this component (that seems to intrinsic to any framework) was pulled into its own frameworks is related to two main definitions: "routing" and "fully native vs partially native". The outcome of this discussion lead the community to maintain two projects:

- React Navigation (Maintained primarily by the reactjs community)
- React Native Navigation (Maintained by WIX)

## Navigation solutions

### React Navigation

This navigation solution, written on top of the react native libraries, allows you to write transitions or extensions directly in javascript as its control flow is hosted by JS.

#### Benefits

- Routes are exposed as part of the same development environment.
- Allows you to write highly customisable navigation.
- Allows you to hook directly to the transitional state and react to it.
- Always up to date with the latest changes of react and react native.
- High integration with redux.

#### Disadvantages

- If the application has implemented its own navigation natively, it does not reuse it immediately.
- Performing background work on the main (js) thread blocks the animation.

### React Native Navigation

Written 100% in native code on both iOS and Android, provides a "simple" api to interact with the js part of the application. Gives you a highly performant component.

#### Benefits

- Has total separation from the JS main thread, meaning that components updating their state as the transition is performing shouldn't interfere with the transition animation.
- Broader support of Android.
- Redux support

#### Disavantages

- Harder to integrate with your app
- Debugging specific navigation state needs to be done via the native development environment.
- Lags behind the react native libraries by a few versions.
- Less used than react navigation
- Version 2 is still under development.

## Exercise

Let's get the basic navigation of flixflix. The app will have a home screen, in which all the movies will be presented for us to choose what we want to watch, get more information about it and/or change a few configurations.

### Create the views

Let's go ahead to create the four main components we will get to work. As we create the views, we want to decrease the amount of duplication, so we will create some styles for each for the views as well.

1. Create a `./src/views` folder (all views are going to be stored here)
1. Create a view for Home (originally called: `HomeView`). This is going to a be pure component as we created it before.
1. Add a `Text` that is going to display the name of the current component.
1. Add a `Button`, the handler of this button is going to be empty at this stage: `onPress={() => {}}`.
    * <sub>Computer says no? check the error message and add what you are missing.</sub>
1. Create a stylesheet called `styles` and create one entry for `homeContainer` which is going to set its size and alignment to display anything in the middle.

```ts
{
    homeContainer: {
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: "center",
        justifyContent: "center" 
    },
    homeText: {
        fontSize: 17
    },
}
```

6. Apply the color `#009ab0` and the text color is going to be `#fff` <span style="background-color:#009ab0; color:#fff;">&nbsp;like this&nbsp;</span>

1. Repeat these steps above to create `DetailsView`, `WishlistView` and `SettingsView`. The colors to use are described below:
    1. Details: background color `#cfbca6` and the text color is going to be `#000000` <span style="background-color:#cfbca6; color:#000000;">&nbsp;like this&nbsp;</span>
    1. Wishlist: background color `#cfbca6` and the text color is going to be `#000000` <span style="background-color:#cfbca6; color:#000000;">&nbsp;like this&nbsp;</span>
    1. Settings: background color `#65b7b1` and the text color is going to be `#ffffff` <span style="background-color:#65b7b1; color:#ffffff;">&nbsp;like this&nbsp;</span>

### Add the navigator dependency.

With this many screens, we need a way to navigate between every bit of the app. For this, we need:

```sh
yarn add react-navigation
yarn add @types/react-navigation --dev
```

### Navigator first steps

The very first navigator we are going to use is called `StackNavigation`. It stacks views as we push new items in, and pops it out when navigating back.

1. Create a new component `./src/views/mainNavigator.tsx`
2. Create the component by calling `createStackNavigator(routeMap, stackConfig)` as follows:

```ts
const MainNavigator = createStackNavigator(routeMap, stackConfig);
```

3. Let's create the `routeMap`, this is going to be an object that describes for a route, which path and screen needs to be displayed.

```ts
const routeMap: NavigationRouteConfigMap = {
    Home: { path: "/", screen: HomeView },
    // This follows the shape of
    // route_name: { path: "route_you_want_to_use", screen: ComponentType }
}
```

4. Do the rest of the routes for details, wishlist and settings.
5. Let's create the stack configutation (it just needs to state which of the routes is the first one, by default the first one to be declared in the routes is picked as the `initialRoute`, but better declare it explicitly).
6. Export the navigator we just generated.
7. To start using the navigator, all we need to do is edit `./src/index.tsx` and replace the registered component to be the `MainNavigator`
8. Run the code.

### How do I trigger the navigation?

1. Go back to `HomeView`
2. The navigator is going to inject all the dependencies required to get the component to work with its references. To expose it as part of our code we need to extend the PureComponent properties with `NavigationScreenProps`

```tsx
//...
import { NavigationScreenProps } from "react-navigation";
//...

class HomeView extends PureComponent<NavigationScreenProps<{}, {}>> {
    constructor(props: NavigationScreenProps<{}, {}>) {
        super(props);
    }
    //...
}
```

Or, just create an alias of the type for `NavigationScreenProps<{}, {}>` so is easier to use (we are not going to change it too much at this stage).

```tsx
//...
type NavProps = NavigationScreenProps<{}, {}>;
//...
class HomeView extends PureComponent<NavProps> {
    constructor(props: NavProps) {
        super(props);
    }
    //...
}
```

Note: Ideally, we could place that `NavProps` somewhere else, as we will be reusing that type soon.

3. Let's create a method to `handleTap`, which takes no arguments.
4. In `handleTap` let's call the navigation process to push a new view by indicating which route name for details needs to be called (check `this.props` you should have new things in there).
5. Run the code and tap on that button.
6. Uhm... it crashed saying `navigation` does not exist... The reason why it tells you that is: `this` is undefined. Here is one of those oddities of javascript that typescript can not avoid. A method (in javascript) knows its original instance as long as there is no context switch. Passing the method to the `onPress` transfers the context from the current container to the button. To fix this, we declare the method from 

```ts
class HomeView /* ... */ {
    handleTap(): void { /*...*/ } 
```

To:

```ts
class HomeView /* ... */ {
    handleTap = (): void => { /*...*/ } 
```

This creates a closure on `this`... it will close on anything that used on that arrow function. Keep this in mind as it can make a difference to write code like this:

```ts
{
    handleWithLimitedCapture: (): void => this.realHandler();

    realHandler(): void { /* do something */ }
    // this one does not close on everything is using,
    // and because the context has switched already,
    // is running under the current instance.
}
```

Do `⌘ + r` to recover from the previous error and reload the app.

7. Hook up the rest of the screens so it navigates from Home ⇢ Details ⇢ Wishlist ⇢ Settings
8. In `Settings` we want to do something a bit different... if we configure it to go to `HomeView` it will continue to loop around, never removing the stack we have generated. Let's learn how to jump to `HomeView` without navigating the elements of stack.
    1. In `handleTap` we want to dispatch a stack action called `reset`.
    2. Because we want to go back to the beginning, let's jump to first element of the stack (by index).
    3. Without anything in the stack, we can specify the actions to navigate to the screen we want. Using the navigation actions, let's navigate to home.
9. Check everything is good. Settings should go back to Home, without the stack.

### Adding a drawer menu

Given hamburger items are super cool, we want to have one for ourselves. This is also part of navigator because this "view" does not need to be loaded all the time. React Navigaion (and react native navigation) have a component that already does that for you. Is called `DrawerNavigator`

To create one we need:

1. Create a file called: `./src/views/appMenu.tsx`
2. Just like the stack navigator, we need to create a drawer navigator by calling its function with a route map and its configuration as shown below:

```tsx
// We want the drawer to be about 2/3 of the screen
import { Dimensions } from "react-native";

const routeMap: NavigationRouteConfigMap = {
    Main: MainNavigator // we have one of these already in our code
};

const { width } = Dimensions.get("screen");

const drawerConfig: DrawerNavigatorConfig = {
    contentComponent: AppMenuView,
    drawerPosition: "right",
    drawerWidth: width * 0.66,
    drawerBackgroundColor: "transparent",
};
```

3. Let's create the component hosting the menu. Call it `AppMenuView`, inside is going to use a `SafeAreaView`, a few `TouchableOpacity` elements to trigger navigation to home, wishlist and settings.
4. Call `navigate(routeName)` to each of the routes we are going to be triggering for each of the elements above.
5. Run it. Without any button to trigger the transition... swipe from the right to get to your menu to pop in the view.

Let's move on to the next exercise...
