# Styles

Almost every single component receives all its visual properties via styles, as you have already noticed. Declaring in-line styles is a pretty bad practice and it will get out of control fast.

```tsx
// great to do quick iterations, really bad in the long run.
render() {
    return (
        <View
            style={{ height: 42, width: 42, backgroundColor: "#ffaabb" }} />
    )
}
```

To handle this in a better way, we can create an object to hold each of the styles we want to create.

## Applying styles

```tsx
import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        paddingTop: 8,
        paddingBottom: 8,
        paddingRight: 8,
        paddingLeft: 8,
    }
    containerWithCenteredItems: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
    },
    redbox: {
        backgroundColor: "red",
    },
    header: {
        fontSize: 19,
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        marginTop: 20,
        marginBottom: 8,
    },
    generalText: {
        fontSize: 14,
        fontWeight: "normal",
    }
});

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
                <Text style={styles.header}>Hello</Text>
                <Text style={styles.generateText}>World</Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}
```

You will have three types of styles `ViewStyle`, `TextStyle` and `ImageStyle`. We are not going to dig deep into each of these. If you are interested on reading more about this:

- [ImageStyle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image-style-props)
- [TextStyle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text-style-props)
- [ViewStyle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view-style-props)

## Applying multiple styles

Segregation and composition are fundamental pillars for react native (and react in general). You will be able to combine multiple styles as:

```tsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    highlightedText: { ... },
    headerText: { ... },
    bodyText: { ... }
});

render() {
    return (
        <View>
            <Text style={[styles.highlightedText, styles.headerText]}>A</Text>
        </View>
    );
}
```

## When to apply a view, text or an image style?

All elements are views, so you can apply a `ViewStyle` to everything. `TextStyle`s are applied to text elements or elements that need to display text and `ImageStyle`s to images.

There might be other styles added by new modules, but these are the default created by react native.

## What about that "flex: 1" thing?

React Native uses a flavour of style sheets called flexbox. Is hard to explain it but a short summary would be: is a flexible way of defining how much and where elements will be displayed.

For instance:

- Without a height or a width, this element does not have a size.

```xml
<View></View>
```

- But, we can tell it to take the entire space by assigning a flex size of 1
```xml
<View style={{ flex: 1}} />
```

- Flex allows the view to share with others. The following example illustrates a root view, expanding as much as possible and two child views, taking 50% of its parent each.
```xml
<View style={{ flex: 1}}>
    <View style={{ flex: 1}} />
    <View style={{ flex: 1}} />
</View>
```

There are a lot of features associated with flex and let's not repeat outselves, here is a [cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/)

## Exercise. Pull all the styles to its own module.

There are multiple practices when it comes down to styles, create objects in the same file, create modules for each one or create a single massive style module... we chosed the last one.

Create a file called `./src/styles.ts` and create styles for each of the elements we have worked on so far.
