# Improving user experience (pagination)

Thankfully, the backend is configured at the moment with a small set of the data (about 600kb), but this is a pretty bad user experience to somebody with a poor internet connection.

Reading the configuration we stored before, there is an api in which we can request pages and the backend will respond with blocks of 20 movies at a time.

Before we move on, let's do some refactoring. That code we placed in the `componentDidMount`... surely we can pull it out to something else, right? Fortunately, the backend provided an adapter to the service with the following interface:

```ts
interface Database {
    getById(movieId: number): Promise<Movie>;
    getPage(pageNumber: number): Promise<Page>;
    getSummarizedPage(pageNumber: number): Promise<SummarizedPage>;
    dumpAll(): Promise<MovieDatabase>;
    getPosterFor(item: {
        poster_path: string | null;
    }): ImageRequireSource | ImageURISource;
    getBackdropFor(item: {
        backdrop_path: string | null;
    }): ImageRequireSource | ImageURISource;
}
```

The implementation can be downloaded from [here](./support/11.remoteDatabase.ts). Save it as `./src/services/remoteDatabase.ts`.

Also download a companion [resource](./support/nope.png) required by the code. Save it as `./static/nope.png`

Now, update the code of `HomeView` to be similar to this:

```tsx
class HomeView extends React.PureComponent<NavProps, HomeState> {
    database: Database; // <- new

    constructor(props: NavProps) {
        super(props);
        this.database = initDatabase(); // <- new
        this.state = {
            movies: []
        };
    }

    // ...
    componentDidMount() {
        this.database // <- new
            .dumpAll() // <- new
            .then(x => {
                this.setState(s => ({
                    ...s,
                    movies: x.all
                }));
            })
            .catch(e => {
                console.error(e);
            });
    }
    //...
}
```

## Pagination

To get the pagination to work, all we need to do is subscribe to a few more events of `FlatList`, so we can fetch a new list as we are getting close to the end. This process is done automatically for us when creating the new rendered items, the problem with that approach is that it assumes you have loaded all the data upfront.

### What do we need?

-   `onRefresh` and `refreshing`: these are provided by the `FlatList` to let you know when we need to source more "new" data. And render appropriately some form of activity indicator to the user.
    -   `onRefresh`: called when the user has requested a refresh of the data by pulling down.
    -   `refreshing`: observes a property to know when it needs to render an activity indicator.
-   `onEndReachedThreshold` and `onEndReached`: allows you to configure the minimum set of items before you reach the end of the list to pull new items.
    -   `onEndReachedThreshold`: this configures the minimum set of items to call the `onEndReached`
    -   `onEndReached` calls your "fetch next page" function.
-   `ListHeaderComponent` and `ListFooterComponent`: used to render a refreshing or fetching more stuff indicator as appropriate.

## Exercise

Assuming your new `HomeViewState` will looks like this:

```ts
interface HomeState {
    movies: Movie[];
    refreshing: boolean;
    loading: boolean;
    page: number;
}
```

1. Initialise the state appropriately. The backend was configured to state at `page: 1`
2. Instead of dumping all the data on you, get the first page in `componentDidMount`
3. Check it all works (less data though).
4. Set `onEndReachedThreshold` to `1`, so the app has a chance of fetching data before you really hit the bottom.
5. Wire up `onEndReached` to a handler originally called `handleEndReached` and fetch the next page from it.
6. When fetching any page, set the state of loading to `true` before the fetch is called, and once it has completed set it back to `false`

_Tip_: `setState` is an async operation, as react will evaluate the new state and check if there is anything to update as the rest of the code is evaluated. `setState` can be used as `this.setState(oldState => { return newState })` or can be used as `this.setState(oldState => { return newState }, () => { /* once the state has been applied, call this continuation */ })` and this is particularly useful when dealing with multiple state changes with async operations.

_Tip 2_: Given an instance of an object with properties `a`, `b` and `c` as: `{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }`, if you want to copy all its values/references to a new instance replacing some of its properties as part of the copy, you can use the spread operator `...` as follows:

```ts
const item = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const newItem = { ...item, b: 42 };
// newItem => { a: 1, b: 42, c: 3 };
```

7. Implement the `ListFooterComponent` to render a `<View />` when nothing is loaded and an `<ActivityIndicator animating={true} size="large" />` when is loading. (if the service is too each... add a `delay` after the fetch to see it working.)
8. Wire up `FlatList.refreshing` property to our state.
9. Wire up `onRefreshing` to a function called `handleRefresh`, which needs to forget all the pages we have downloaded previously and fetch a brand new first page.

That's it. We have implemented pagination.
