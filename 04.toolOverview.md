# Learning vscode

As you know by now, vscode is an editor based on electron, full open source and highly customisable. It has become the favourite editor and supports almost every programming language (syntax highlight).

## What can it do?

To get to know our editor (before we dig into react native), let's set up a small project (workspace) for node, this way we will learn how to debug some code and what else we will be able to do.

## Checking out the editor

### The left panel

The left panel is your main accessor across multiple functionality such as:

- Workspace explorer
- Search (and replace)
- Git
- Debug
- Extensions
- ... and settings (right at the bottom)

Each of these sections will contain its own panel that can be expanded or contracted. Let's check out each of these for a second.

### The editor

There is no need to explain the editor. Just be aware you can add breakpoints to the left of your text (between the line numbers and expansion area).

The editor comes configured out of the box with syntax highlight of the most popular programming languages, but the vscode community is very active and every programming language has a language pack or extension enabling an unsupported language in a few clicks.

The editor also has this concept of snippits that can be triggered by typing a few letters and pressing tab when suggested.

### Useful things to know

#### ⌘P

**Your dear friend**. This keybinding allows you to access everything. By default, when you press '⌘P' you will be able to switch between files or open new files.

Once this window is opened, you can trigger other functions such as:

- '?' shows you all the commands you can trigger
- '#' search by symbol
- '>' find editor function/setting
- ':' go to line

There are a lot more. Give it a go.

#### ⇧⌘P

This is a short of of '⌘P' with '>'

#### ⇧⌘Space

Show function definition/associated information. Active for most programming languages that are strongly typed. For Ruby (as an example), you might need `solargraph` to inspect the objects and give you information about it.

### Let's create a first project and debug a method

Building a simple calculator.

The calculator will have two operations: add and substract. The user interface is going to be console app given by the following program:

```js
// file: index.js
const readline = require("readline");
const calc = require("./calculator");

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
})

const calculator = new calc;

function getOperation(opString) {
    if (opString.toLowerCase() === "add") {
        return calculator.add
    } else if (opString.toLowerCase() === "subs") {
        return calculator.substract;
    }
    else {
        return undefined;
    }
}

function queryOperation() {
    rl.question("What would you like to do (add, subs)? > ", (answer) => {
        if (!answer) queryOperation();
        
        var operation = getOperation(answer);
        if (!operation) queryOperation();

        rl.question("Provide the first number > ", (a) => {
            rl.question("Provide second number > ", (b) => {
                console.log(`The result of ${answer} is: ${operation(parseInt(a), parseInt(b))}`);
                process.exit();
            });
        });
    });
}

queryOperation();
```

Additionally, you have been provided with a package configuration for a node app (can be created by `npm init`):

```json
{
  "name": "calculator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "It will do some hard science... sort of speak.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "./node_modules/.bin/jest"
  },
  "author": "Workshop",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^5.2.0",
    "jest": "^23.4.2"
  },
  "jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "node"
  }
}
```

You need to write a `calculator` module, test it make it pass.

#### Hits

- Tests will be located in a `__tests__` folder, and the file should be named `calculator.tests.js`
- A sample test is:

```js
describe("This is my first scenario!", () => {
    test("thou shalt not lie!", () => {
        expect(true).toBeTruthy();
    });

    test("thou shalt not pass!", () => {
        expect("Xerx loves to run barefoot").toBe(true);
        // sigh... js allows you to do this...
        // although the test runner will complain about different types.
    });
})
```

- Don't forget to `yarn`!
- And to `yarn run test`

### All done?

Let's change that project to be able to debug the code...

1. Go into the debug panel.
2. Tap on "add configuration" and choose "node.js" from the list.
3. Go to `index.js` and replace the last line to `calculator.add(42, 0);`
4. Tap to the side for a debug point in `add(a, b)` so we can inspect the actual values.
5. Hit debug! (select the `launch program` option if it is not preselected).
