# There is a bit of myth around React Native.

## Introduction

Just like the Sasquatch / Big Foot stories, there are tons of tales (fairy tales or spooky stories) about React Native and a lot of other frameworks, and we will be checking some of them... but I need to ask you something:

If we write software to help us build other software... effectively, we write tools... why do we always try to use a hammer when we have a toolbox with lots of other tools? why do we always see nails? The point here is (and I am going to put it out in the open before we continue):

1. React Native does not solve all the problems. Just like any other tool, this one has its purpose and its moments to shine. It is important to understand when the foot does not fit the shoe as much as when the shoe fits well enough.

2. Software tools do not fix culture issues. Fandom is a really nasty condition, it prevents you from seeing virtue where it is, or spotting defects where you should spot them. It promotes a toxic environment that retrofits its own conspiracy theories with flawed logic proving it true. Why is this important? Well, if you are going to do this workshop to poke holes in it, you might miss the main goal: learning what this is about and what inspiration can it take with me.

3. AirBnB is not an authority in react native or software development practices. Yes, they are moving away from react native because of different issues they had using the framework and they are also trying to promote a new visual design language called epoxy. It was explained as part of the post saying why they are moving away from react native. With that said, the main community building the framework continues to grow and more recently, facebook decided rewrite the framework to tackle some of the issues reported by AirBnB and Wix. There are multiple companies backing up the project and even companies like Google are using it as inspiration to create their own frameworks.

With that said, let's take a look at some of the myths around React Native:


## 1. Is a cross-platform/multi-platform framework.

Just one instance of the entire React Native documentation using the term "Cross-platform" [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/platform-specific-code) and that is intentional. React Native is not a cross-platform framework. Is a framework that allows you to write code in JavaScript, mapping UI elements to its native counterparts. The main intention of RN is to enable you to write code in the same environment/manner to target multiple platforms. It just happens that, you might be able to reuse business logic across multiple platforms when the business logic is not dependent on native behaviours.


## 2. You can't achieve great looking apps.

Multiple companies have used RN to create their apps without issues. Some of them have created these apps to target certain markets others to be able to reuse their talent. One thing is quite true: there are a lot of rubbish apps out there... but that is true for purely native and RN apps. Let's take a look at some apps written with RN:

- Instagram. Minimal design: clean, intuitive, performant. Does well what it needs to do.
- Discord. This app connects vast groups of gamers, developers, traders around the world.
UberEats. Mixes up a clean design with beautiful content.
- Gyroscope. Need to track your steps, check your heart rate and review your stats quickly? This one gives you beautiful graphics to go with it (integrates with HealthKit)
- Discovery VR. Find yourself immersed with this app that integrates VR and RN without you noticing what is what.
- Townske. Basically, a multimedia travel guide that has managed to combine their rich content with a great user experience.
- Tesla app. What can you say? it includes beautiful images of a beautiful car at your fingertips.
- Shine. This mindfulness and meditation app was even featured in the iOS app store as one of the most beautiful apps that year (2016) and multiple other times as "App of the day"


## 3. You will need just a hand full of developers for all your needs. You don't need two development teams.

Remember what I said before about writing code "cross-platform"? You need people that understand the native behaviour and the native API to allow you to optimise your experience. The difference here is, you unify your language and some of the duplications can be removed allowing the teams to focus on other tasks.

In addition to that, developers trained in the native platform also understand the subtle differences of behaviours that contribute to enrich the user interface.

## 4. But it is so slow!

Certainly, it could be a lot faster and there are a few quirks of the framework that are plain weird (like the fact that JavaScript obscures the usage of threads under an event loop, giving you the notion of a single thread to do everything), but the framework itself has been optimised to maintain a frame rate of 60 frames per second, and very few devices go above this benchmark.

Now, react native uses a different philosophy when dealing with UI elements that can be problematic to some developers at first and can lead to memory leaks and issues affecting the performance of the app... but what framework doesn't have its gotchas when you are learning a new technology? In this workshop, we will look at some of this and hopefully avoid them when working with the code.

## 5. I will be able to use the code of my website

Nope! Not without some effort.

Most websites built using a react framework are based on reactjs or preactjs. Both use html5 and html fragments are its UI elements.

React Native uses a common language to mask native controls/views and it resolves to this elements. This approach allows you to create a portable product that can easily bridge functionality across multiple platforms. Now... you can also choose to use the native components and write dedicated user experiences for each platform.
