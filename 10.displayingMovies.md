# Building the home screen

The home screen is a place where we want to display the list of all the movies sorted by popularity. Thankfully, the backend already has this data sorted for us in a simple to use json api.

## Understanding the backend data

The backend that has been provided to us, consist in a web api "similar" to a json rest api.

We should be able to call the server as:

```sh
curl https://api.example.com/{guid}/json/allmovies.json -o "everything.json"
```

The data structure of the backend is as follows:

```ts
interface MovieDatabase {
    all: Movie[];
}

interface Movie {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    overview: string;
    video: boolean;
    adult: boolean;
    popularity: number; // ranges between 0 to 1000
    vote_count: number; // total number of votes.
    vote_average: number; // ranges between 0 to 10
    original_title: string;
    original_language: string;
    poster_path: string; // it can be null
    backdrop_path: string; // it can be null
    release_date: string; // 2000-01-31
    genre_ids: number[];
}
```

Which will match the following file:

```json
{
    "all": [
        {
            "id": 5150,
            "title": "American Beauty",
            "overview": "Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis, decides to turn his hectic life around after developing an infatuation with his daughter's attractive friend.",
            "video": false,
            "adult": false,
            "popularity": 15.576,
            "vote_count": 5118,
            "vote_average": 8,
            "original_title": "American Beauty",
            "original_language": "en",
            "poster_path": "/american-beauty.jpg",
            "backdrop_path": "/american-beauty-b.jpg",
            "release_date": "1999-09-15",
            "genre_ids": [18]
        }
    ]
}
```

So, go ahead and create a file called `./src/models/index.ts` and place the definitions above in it.

## Before we continue!

As this workshop is publicly available and the data was accessed from [the movie db](https://www.themoviedb.org/), the actual data and the web endpoint containing the data is not going to be disclosed. To keep all of this away from public domain, let's create a file containing this private configuration and exclude it from source control.

1. Create a `./secrets.json` file
2. Request the content of this file to the instructor (it might be attached to the invite).
3. Add the following line to your `.gitignore` file

```bash
# ...
.vscode/.react
.expo/
gen/
secrets.json # <- this is new
```

**Note:** Because we are excluding from source control this file, if you call `git clean ./ -fdx`, this configuration will be deleted. Keep a copy handy just in case.

## Let's display all the data!

1. Open `HomeView` (⌘ + p > homeview)
2. Add a `FlatList` component under `Button` and assign a `style={{ flex: 1 }}` at this moment.
3. The component should be complaining about `data`, `renderItem` and `keyExtractor`. Let's add some of those quickly to avoid compilation issues:

```tsx
<FlatList
    style={{ flex: 1 }}
    data={[1, 2, 3]}
    renderItem={x => null}
    keyExtractor={x => `${x}`}
/>
```

-   `data` is pretty much self explanatory why we need.
-   `renderItem` is a function requesting how to draw new items as these pop into view. The function has the following signature: `(item: T, index: number, separators) => JSX.Element`
-   `keyExtractor` is a function that tries to generate a unique identifier for each element of the visual collection. These are not created automatically but is highly recommended for you to provide a unique way of identifying your items. The key extractor follows this signature: `(item: ItemT, index: number) => string`

4. Let's run the code above first to check everything displays properly. No errors should appear.
5. Let's display something for each item.
    1. As part of `HomeView`, create a method called `renderMovie` with the following signature: `renderMovie = (x: ListRenderItemInfo<number>): JSX.Element => { }`
    2. Make it return a new `View` with a background color `#cfbca6`, add some padding to it and some margin as well. Let's say `16`?
    3. Add a text child element to that view to display the number. In here, you might need to do something similar to string interpolation. `<Text style={{ alignItems: "center" }}>{x.item}</Text>`
    4. Run it.
6. Now, let's change the code to display the movies.
    1. First, let's move those numbers to be part of the state of the current view. Create a `HomeViewState` interface with a `movies` property.
    2. Change the component so it knows the shape of its state.
    3. Change the constructor to initalise `this.state` property.
    4. Change the `FlatList.data` to use `this.state.movies`
    5. Run it.
    6. If all works fine. Let's change the numbers array to actual instances of movies. Update the definitions from `number` to `Movie`. The initial state should be `[]`
    7. At this stage, `keyExtractor` might be complaining. Change it to use the `x.item.id` as the key of each item. Remember this function requires a `string`
    8. We want to load information as soon as the view is presented... to trigger the request we need to override a method called `componentDidMount`.
    9. Now, we need to get the url of our service from the secret configuration. To do that we call in `componentDidMount`: `const config = require("../../secrets.json");`. This loads the json content into an object.
    10. Next, we fetch the data from the server:

```ts
const config = require("../../secrets.json");

fetch(config.urls.movies.full)
    .then(x => x.text())
    .then(x => JSON.parse(x) as MovieDatabase)
    .then(x =>
        this.setState(s => ({
            // updating the state.
            ...s,
            movies: x.all
        }))
    )
    .catch(e => console.error(e));
// that's all.
```

Run it!

## Exercise

So far, the component is displaying in a list the name of each movie.

### Update the row design.

We want to add a "leaf" design to each row. To achieve this:

- Set the style of the item to have a minimum height of 150 and the `borderTopLeftRadius` and `borderBottomRightRadius` to   `16`.
- Additionally, we want to show an image side by side of its text. To do this, set the style with a `flexDirection` of `row`.
- Display the image of each movie to the left of the tile and its title to the right.
- If the image is overflowing the parent container. Set the `overflow` to `hidden` to generate a mask on all the children.
- Navigate to the detail screen on tap of each of these elements (do not worry about passing any information to the next container).

*Note:* don't bother pulling the styles from this section, at the moment we are experimenting and this needs a lot more work.
