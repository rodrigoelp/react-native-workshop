# Passing arguments around

## Introduction

So far, we have explored how to fetch data and presented on a view, as well as navigating across multiple views. But, if I want to get more details, what do I need to do?

The navigation mechanism provides a simple process, when you are navigating to a new screen, you will be able to provide the arguments of the new view. These will be injected as part of the navigation arguments, hosted as part of the view's properties.

Ready to implement it yourself?

## From master to details

In `homeView.tsx`:

1. Rename `handleTap` to `showMovieDetails` as that will match the intention we'll do in the near future.
2. Close on the `movie` so the handler knows which movie you are dealing with. E.g: Here, `m` is captured `() => someHandler(m)`.
3. Remove whatever is giving you issues as part of the change of `handleTap`
4. The `push` of a new route, also takes second argument called parameters. Complete the second argument of this method with an object with a single property called `selectedMovie` of type `Movie`.
5. Check everything works. At this point, your application should navigate to the details view.

In `detailsView.tsx`:

6. Now, the screen initiating the navigation provides the selected movie, but the details have not been pulled out:
    1. Create a type called `NavParams`<sup>(<a href="#note1">1</a>)</sup> that matches the object passed as part of the previous `push` call <sup>(<a href="#note2">2</a>)</sup>.
    2. Check the type definition of `NavigationScreenProps` used by `DetailsView`. Provide the new type where required.
    3. In `render`, get the parameter matching the selected movie into a constant, so you can work with it.
7. Display the title, original title, language, vote average  and movie overview. Don't worry it looks all like crap, we will get it looking better in a bit.
8. Finally, include a button at the bottom of the view to `add to wishlist` this movie (just rename the `handleTap` to `addToWishlist`).

## Wishlist

1. As we need to provide some data to the wishlist (movies we have added over time), let's create a single instance called `store` in a file called `./src/services/localStore.ts`. The object follows this definition:

```ts
interface Store {
    wishlist: Array<Movie>;

    add(movie: Movie): void;
    remove(movie: Movie): void;
}
```

To create a singleton in js/ts is pretty simple... Just declare it as follows and export it:

```ts
const wishlistStore = new Store();

export { wishlistStore };
```

2. Getting the selected movie from the navigation parameters, add it to the store and proceed to navigate to the wishlist.
3. In the wishlist, pull the list of movies you have added over time, and display it.
4. Add a button to the right of the movie to delete it if you don't want to see this movie any more.
5. When a movie has been deleted, refresh the view to reflect the right state.
6. Check everything "works".

**Note:** At this stage, we could continue trying to solve some of the issues we observe here, such as (and depending on how you tried to refresh the view):
- You pushed the movies of the wishlist as state of the current view. In this case, you have duplicated the state as captured by the store... introducing state duplication.
- Or you tried to navigate to the same view with new items... stacking more views which is really useful to the user.

But we are going to learn pretty soon a new tool, that similar to react (turning views into immutable objects) we can think of the state associated to views... or stores as immutable objects as well.

<sup>(<a name="note1">1</a>) you can define a type as:</sup>
```ts
type NavParams = { selectedMovie: Movie };
```
<sup>Or as:</sup>
```ts
interface NavParams { selectedMovie: Movie }
```
<sup>**to all practical effects of this workshop**, these two are interchangable.</sup>

<sup>(<a name="note2">2</a>)Alternatively, we could've created a type to represent the selection of a movie. Avoiding the redefinition of a similar object here, but we will be changing that after this exercise</sup>
