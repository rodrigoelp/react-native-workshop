# Enough of theory and little practice. The FlixFlix app!

Let's set up our first app in react native.

We want to build the Flixflix app, a browser of upcoming movies. This app should allow us to:
- Visualise some information about the movie or its complete details
- add the movie a wishlist (so we are always up to date and never miss one)

## READ THIS FIRST!!!

To create an app in react native, all you need to do is:

```sh
react-native init Flixflix
```

This will set up the initial boilerplate.

Facebook also offers a different app called: `create-react-native-app`, it assumes you want a specific project structure and it preconfigures everything for you. In my opinion, this script makes things a lot harder when it comes to learning (or maintaining an app).

And... because this is javascript, there are 10 different ways of getting things started. You've got [expo](https://expo.io/) and [ignite](https://infinite.red/ignite), both are used to kickstart your project with some of their own assumptions. It can generate lots of your code and it gives you sample code to start working on... but expo in particular tries to avoid you learning the little details of react native (that you will need to learn) and ignite assumes you are an expert of every plugin you request to include. So we are not going to be using any of these.

Alternatively, you could use the template created by [Emin Khateeb](https://github.com/emin93/react-native-template-typescript) by calling:

```sh
react-native init Flixflix --template typescript && node Flixflix/setup.js
```

... but that is not how we roll. Let's set up our project step by step to get to know what is going on.

Once we have the boilerplate generated, we need to change it from javascript/flow to typescript. That will just take two steps. From there, we will continue to build our app.


## First step. Let's create the app.

```sh
# Step 1.
react-native init Flixflix

# Step 2, check everything works
# this will compile the code
# run the bundler and run the simulator.
react-native run-ios # (or run-android)
```

Check your simulator and your initial app is configured and running.

## What just happened?

Skipping the compilation, you noticed a new terminal opening. This is called the metro bundler. It takes all your javascript, images and other resources (libraries, files, etc) referenced by your code and packages it to deliver it to your app in debug mode. Once you have finished development, you won't need the metro bundler because you will bundle everything pre-emptively and add it as a resource in your app.

#### What does this bundler thing do?

The very short statement is: it allows you to change things as you build your app without having to rebuild.

## Step 3: Updating styles.

Let's give it a try, and do some 'on the air' updates:

Search for `StyleSheet.create` (usually is line 32) and change the container to have a background of `#add2c2`

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: "#add2c2",
    //backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',
  },
  welcome: {
    fontSize: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
    margin: 10,
  },
  instructions: {
    textAlign: 'center',
    color: '#333333',
    marginBottom: 5,
  },
});
```

Go to the simulator and hit reload on the simulator: `⌘r`

Now, you can activate live updates, on the simulator tap `⌘d` to get the debug menu, then choose "live updates"

Change the background color to `#A7D3A6`

## Step 4. Changing it all to typescript

It is customary to install the tools you need (such as typescript compiler) as part of your project. That way people know which version of the tools you were using. Is also pretty handy to get everything up and running in CI.

### Installing typescript
To install typescript:

```sh
yarn add typescript --dev
```

### Side note

At the time I was writing this guide, the latest version of typescript was 3.0.1. If later on we run into issues, we might need to run the script below:

```sh
# JUST IF WE RUN INTO ISSUES
yarn remove typescript 
yarn add typescript@3.0.1 --dev
```
### Creating a typescript project

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --init --pretty --jsx react-native --module commonjs --target es2017 --lib es2017 --sourceMap --outDir ./gen/
```

This should create a `tsconfig.json` file. Go ahead and open it as we need to change something there.

At the bottom of the file, add the include tag pointing to the `src` folder. We want to keep out typescript code separate from our javascript code.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": { ... },
  "include": [
    "./src"
  ]
}
```

### First typescript file

Now, let's create our first react native view in typescript:

```tsx
// file ./src/index.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { View, AppRegistry } from "react-native";

// this func is also a class. Don't worry, this is a hack.
const App = () => (<View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: "red" }} />);

// you will need to register the class as part of your code and entry point.
AppRegistry.registerComponent("flixflix", () => App);
```

Uh... vscode is complaining it does not know "react" nor "react-native"... Well, these two libraries do not include by default their type definitions.

Luckily, somebody already did that work for us and all we need to do is:

```sh
yarn add @types/react @types/react-native --dev
```

Check again in vscode... and everything should be good now.

Typescript requires type definitions to be able to validate the code you are writing. There are lots of type definitions already available at [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) as the typescript community is growing by the minute. Now... some libraries are written directly in typescript and the authors do not push their types into this repo.  When using a new library, check if it has its type def already.

### Hooking things up

If you check the app, your code wasn't called. We need to hook it up first at the app's entry point.

Change the file `./index.js` to:

```js
import "./gen";
```

Reload...

and kaboom! We could not find "gen/index", what's going on?

Well, typescript needs to compile the code. Go back to terminal and type:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/tsc
```

And reload.

### Making things easier

Typing the compile line is going to quickly grow old. Let's make it a tad better. Open the `package.json` file and add:

```sh
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "compile": "./node_modules/.bin/tsc"
  },
  ...
}
```

Check it all works:

```sh
yarn run compile
```

## Step 5. Checking the debugger

We already mentioned how to configure vscode to debug your code. Let's create that configuration now.

1. Tap on debug
2. Add new configuration
3. Choose react native (this will add 4 configurations)
4. Customise your debugger.
    - I have duplicated "debug ios" to have "debug ios (default)" and "debug ios (iPhone X)"
    - In "iPhone X" I added `"runArguments": [ "--simulator", "iPhone X" ]`. Alternatively, you could add `"runArguments": [ "--device", "khal drogo's phone" ]`

## Step 6. Let's restore the app to its original glory

Copy the javascript code of `./app.js` into `./src/app.tsx`

## Step 7. Clean the project.

Delete `.flowconfig`. You are not going to need that.
You don't need the `app.js` file either.

## Step 8. Ignore your js files...

You will be generating lots of files. It might be a good idea to ignore the following files:

```sh
# Add these to your .gitignore file
gen/
.vscode/.react/
```
