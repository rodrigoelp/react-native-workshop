# Styles

Almost every single component receives all its visual properties via styles, as you have already noticed. Declaring in-line styles is a pretty bad practice and it will get out of control fast.

```tsx
// great to do quick iterations, really bad in the long run.
render() {
    return (
        <View
            style={{ height: 42, width: 42, backgroundColor: "#ffaabb" }} />
    )
}
```

To handle this in a better way, we can create an object to hold each of the styles we want to create.

## Applying styles

```tsx
import { StyleSheet } from "react-native";

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        paddingTop: 8,
        paddingBottom: 8,
        paddingRight: 8,
        paddingLeft: 8,
    }
    containerWithCenteredItems: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
    },
    redbox: {
        backgroundColor: "red",
    },
    header: {
        fontSize: 19,
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        marginTop: 20,
        marginBottom: 8,
    },
    generalText: {
        fontSize: 14,
        fontWeight: "normal",
    }
});

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
                <Text style={styles.header}>Hello</Text>
                <Text style={styles.generateText}>World</Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}
```

You will have three types of styles `ViewStyle`, `TextStyle` and `ImageStyle`. We are not going to dig deeply into each of these. If you are interested on reading more:

- [ImageStyle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image-style-props)
- [TextStyle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text-style-props)
- [ViewStyle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view-style-props)

## Applying multiple styles

Segregation and composition are fundamental pillars for react native (and react in general). You will be able to combine multiple styles as:

```tsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    highlightedText: { ... },
    headerText: { ... },
    bodyText: { ... }
});

render() {
    return (
        <View>
            <Text style={[styles.highlightedText, styles.headerText]}>A</Text>
        </View>
    );
}
```

## When to apply a view, text or an image style?

All elements are views, so you can apply a `ViewStyle` to everything. `TextStyle`s are applied to text elements or elements that need to display text and `ImageStyle`s to images.

There might be other styles added by new modules, but these are the default created by react native.

## What about that "flex: 1" thing?

React Native uses a flavour of style sheets called flexbox. Is hard to explain it but a short summary would be: is a flexible way of defining how much and where elements will be displayed.

For instance:

- Without a height or a width, this element does not have a size.

```xml
<View></View>
```

- But, we can tell it to take the entire space by assigning a flex size of 1
```xml
<View style={{ flex: 1}} />
```

- Flex allows the view to share with others. The following example illustrates a root view, expanding as much as possible and two child views, taking 50% of its parent each.
```xml
<View style={{ flex: 1}}>
    <View style={{ flex: 1}} />
    <View style={{ flex: 1}} />
</View>
```

There are a lot of features associated with flex and let's not repeat outselves, here is a [cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/).

## Exercise. Learning what styles can do.

Have a play (a few minutes) to generate different styles. Notice you can't apply `fontSize` to a `ViewStyle`. We are not going to create a `StyleSheet` for every one of these components as we are not going to be using them soon. We will be creating a lot more styles pretty soon.

Check differences between `ViewStyle`, `TextStyle` and `ImageStyle` by: âŒ˜ + click

If you want to move a little further ahead, create a file called `index.ts` in the `./src/styles` folder. In here, we will be creating a lot of new styles when we start creating the screens we will be working on.
