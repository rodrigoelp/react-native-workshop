# Testing the app.

We saw a few exercises ago, how to write a few tests... here is a test sample:

```ts
describe("Calculator scenarios", () => {
    test("should add two number", () => {
        expect(Calculator.add(2, 2)).toBe(4);
    });

    test("should substract two number", () => {
        expect(Calculator.sub(2, 2)).toBe(0);
    });
});
```

This is all good for unit tests, if you want to run end to end test, you might need to use a black box software (such as test complete) to validate the app.

React Native can use products like that or it can use a type of gray box, that is, the app does not need to be modified too much and the software can execute a series of commands to get the application to perform actions.
